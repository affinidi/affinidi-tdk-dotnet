# Affinidi Trust Development Kit (Affinidi TDK)

The Affinidi Trust Development Kit (Affinidi TDK) is a modern interface that allows you to easily manage and integrate [Affinidi Elements](https://docs.affinidi.com/docs/affinidi-elements/) and [Frameworks](https://docs.affinidi.com/frameworks/iota-framework/) into your application. It minimises dependencies and enables developers to integrate seamlessly into the [Affinidi Trust Network (ATN)](https://docs.affinidi.com/docs/).

## How do I use Affinidi TDK?

The Affinidi TDK provides three types of modules:

- [Clients](src/Clients), which offer methods to access Affinidi Elements services like Credential Issuance, Credential Verification, and Login Configurations, among others.
- [Packages](src/Packages), which are commonly used utilities/helpers that are self-contained and composable.

## Requirements

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) **(minimum version: `8.0.400`)**
- Compatible OS: Windows, macOS, or Linux

You can check your installed version using:

```bash
dotnet --version
```

ðŸ’¡ This project uses a `global.json` to enforce SDK version consistency. If you donâ€™t have the specified version installed, the build may fail.

## Installation

### Creating a New Project

1. Create a project directory: `mkdir my-dotnet-app`
2. Create the project: `dotnet create console`


### Installing a TDK client or packages with dotnet

To install TDK client or package in dotnet, you need to run the command below:
`dotnet add package <Affinidi-Package-Name> --version <Package-Version>`

Example (installing the AffinidiTdk.AuthProvider Package):
`dotnet add package AffinidiTdk.AuthProvider --version 1.0.0`

The Clients and Packages will be available in [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/).


## Quickstart

Here's a basic example of using the TDK to list Login Configurations:

```dotnet
using AffinidiTdk.AuthProvider;
using AffinidiTdk.LoginConfigurationClient.Api;
using AffinidiTdk.LoginConfigurationClient.Client;
using AffinidiTdk.LoginConfigurationClient.Model;

public class ListLoginConfig
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Instantiate AuthProviderConfig object to load the AuthProvider.
        // Ensure that these sensitive information are kept safe. 
        // You may use `DotNetEnv` to load this info from your .env
        var authProviderParams = new AuthProviderParams
        {
            ProjectId = '<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>',
            TokenId = '<YOUR-TOKEN-ID>',
            PrivateKey = '<YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY>'
        };

        // create an AuthProvider instance
        AuthProvider authProvider = new AuthProvider(authProviderParams);

        // fetch the projectScopedToken from the authProviderConfig
        string projecScopedToken = await authProvider.FetchProjectScopedTokenAsync();
        
        // create an instance of Configuration from AffinidiTdk.LoginConfigurationClient
        Configuration config = new Configuration();

        // set the projectScopedToken as apiKey. Note that its using a Map/Dictionary. Key here is "authorization"
        config.AddApiKey("authorization", projectScopedToken);

        // create an instance of ConfigurationApi (from AffinidTdk.LoginConfigurationClient) and pass the config in the constructor argument.
        ConfigurationApi api = new ConfigurationApi(config);

        // Call ListLoginConfig from the api
        ListLoginConfigurationOutput result = api.ListLoginConfigurations();

        // print the result as JSON
        Console.WriteLine("Login Configurations: " + loginConfig.ToJson());
    }
}

```
