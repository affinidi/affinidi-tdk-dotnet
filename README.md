# Affinidi Trust Development Kit (Affinidi TDK) for .NET

The Affinidi Trust Development Kit (Affinidi TDK) is a modern interface that allows you to build privacy-first identity apps in .NET with minimal setup.
It allows you to easily manage and integrate [Affinidi Elements](https://docs.affinidi.com/docs/affinidi-elements/) and [Frameworks](https://docs.affinidi.com/frameworks/iota-framework/) into your application. It minimises dependencies and enables developers to integrate seamlessly into the [Affinidi Trust Network (ATN)](https://docs.affinidi.com/docs/).


## How do I use Affinidi TDK?

The Affinidi TDK provides two types of modules:

- [Clients](src/Clients), which offer methods to access Affinidi Elements services like Credential Issuance, Credential Verification, and Login Configurations, among others.
- [Packages](src/Packages), which are commonly used utilities/helpers that are self-contained and composable.


<a id="requirements"></a>
## Requirements

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) **(minimum version: `8.0.400`)**
- Compatible OS: Windows, macOS, or Linux

You can check your installed version using:

```bash
dotnet --version
```

ðŸ’¡ This project uses a `global.json` to enforce SDK version consistency. If you donâ€™t have the specified version installed, the build may fail.

<a id="installation"></a>
## Installation

### Creating a New Project

1. Create a project directory: `mkdir my-dotnet-app`
2. Create the project: `dotnet create console`


### Installing a TDK client or packages with .NET

To install TDK client or package in dotnet, you need to run the command below:

`dotnet add package <Affinidi-Package-Name>`

Example (installing the AffinidiTdk.AuthProvider Package):

`dotnet add package AffinidiTdk.AuthProvider`

The Clients and Packages will be available in [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/).

<a id="quickstart"></a>
## Quickstart

Here's a basic example of using the .NET TDK to create a wallet using **WalletsApi** from **[AffinidiTdk.WalletsClient](https://github.com/affinidi/affinidi-tdk-dotnet/tree/main/src/Clients/WalletsClient)**:

```csharp
using AffinidiTdk.AuthProvider;
using AffinidiTdk.WalletsClient.Client;
using AffinidiTdk.WalletsClient.Api;
using AffinidiTdk.WalletsClient.Model;

public class CreateWalletExample
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Instantiate AuthProviderConfig object to load the AuthProvider.
        // Ensure that these sensitive information are kept safe. 
        // You may use `DotNetEnv` to load this info from your .env
        var authProviderParams = new AuthProviderParams
        {
            // These are sample Values Only, please generate your own Personal Access Tokens (PAT). 
            // Please refer to https://docs.affinidi.com/dev-tools/affinidi-tdk/get-access-token/#create-a-personal-access-token-pat for the guide on creating your own PAT.
            ProjectId = "c0be7a6f-36db-41ab-8069-ccfaa30d4a31", 
            TokenId = "d26653a5-60c3-42eb-824b-d6878ae99c2e", 
            PrivateKey = "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----MIICXQIBAAKBgQCWGnSOnz0hCtrdkl7y4dRyR3jAKUjlq1Sx1Zs3pjyZYVO5TDWE6KGwoYxIUBecsKdO98hvIRqI6xXtWNpfb++yldBPbEcH/+Vu3oJGevhrsUCQQCRA4M6Pp8Oe1yWCxmiJyI08xvwwpnABVcXXLAHxq/LX92kJa3s9qXpzbgj8Uwl53B6F2Nzs0NtxQnT73To3fMh-----END PRIVATE KEY-----" 
        };

        // create an AuthProvider instance
        AuthProvider authProvider = new AuthProvider(authProviderParams);

        // fetch the projectScopedToken from the authProviderConfig
        string projecScopedToken = await authProvider.FetchProjectScopedTokenAsync();
        
        // create an instance of Configuration from AffinidiTdk.LoginConfigurationClient
        Configuration config = new Configuration();

        // set the projectScopedToken as apiKey. Note that its using a Map/Dictionary. Key here is "authorization"
        config.AddApiKey("authorization", projectScopedToken);

        // create an instance of ConfigurationApi (from AffinidiTdk.WalletsClient.Api) and pass the config in the constructor argument.
        WalletApi api = new WalletApi(config);

        // prepare the input data to create a wallet
        CreateWalletInput input = new CreateWalletInput(name: "DotNet Wallet", didMethod: CreateWalletInput.DidMethodEnum.Key); 

        // call the CreateWallet operation
        CreateWalletResponse result  = api.CreateWallet(input);
        
        // print the result
        Console.WriteLine("CreateWallet Result: " + result.ToJson());
    }
}
```

Running the code will display the result similar to below:

```bash

CreateWallet Result: {
  "wallet": {
    "id": "fsdfdsf298340832904...",
    "did": "did:key:djsaildjo92u930u0j9frjfsdfdsff...",
    "name": "DotNet Wallet",
    "ari": "ari:identity:ap-southeast-1:759696e3-249b-4ed1-a5bb-34d68e329c0c:wallet/25969eb3219054597ce405d1c24c9b05",
    "keys": [
      {
        "id": "4fb137fe-4012-40c6-bd0a-039d02003cad",
        "ari": "ari:identity:ap-southeast-1:759696e3-249b-4ed1-a5bb-34d68e329c0c:key/6af24104090fb9583b6c4f1f7bddf080-4621a2278bd7ea1a"
      }
    ]
  }
}

```

You may find more examples [here](examples).

### Important Reminder

When handling tokens, it is important that your project access token is managed properly to prevent failures due to expired tokens. 

We have created an [example code](https://github.com/affinidi/affinidi-tdk-dotnet/blob/main/examples/HookAuthExample/HookAuthExample.cs) which handles the automatic refresh of tokens to ensure that the token used in the client APIs are fresh.
