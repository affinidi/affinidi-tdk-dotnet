# Affinidi Trust Development Kit (TDK) for .NET

The Affinidi TDK empowers developers to streamline the integration of Affinidi services into their applications with comprehensive tools, reducing integration effort and improving productivity.
This toolkit also makes it easy to integrate [Affinidi Elements](https://docs.affinidi.com/docs/affinidi-elements/) and [Frameworks](https://docs.affinidi.com/frameworks/iota-framework/) into your application. It enables developers to integrate seamlessly into the [Affinidi Trust Network (ATN)](https://docs.affinidi.com/docs/).

With Affinidi TDK, developers can build privacy-first identity applications in .NET, supporting use-cases such as [enabling passwordless login experience for your users](https://docs.affinidi.com/docs/affinidi-login/), [implementing consent-driven data sharing](https://docs.affinidi.com/frameworks/iota-framework/), and [issuing verifiable credentials (VCs) to your users](https://docs.affinidi.com/docs/affinidi-elements/credential-issuance/).

## How do I use Affinidi TDK?

The Affinidi TDK provides two types of modules:

- [Clients](https://docs.affinidi.com/dev-tools/affinidi-tdk/dotnet/clients/): offer methods to access Affinidi Elements services like Credential Issuance, Credential Verification, and Login Configurations, among others.
- [Packages](https://docs.affinidi.com/dev-tools/affinidi-tdk/dotnet/packages/): are commonly used utilities/helpers that are self-contained and composable.



## Requirements

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) **(minimum version: `8.0.400`)**

You can check your installed version using:

```bash
dotnet --version
```

ðŸ’¡ This project uses a `global.json` to enforce SDK version consistency. If you donâ€™t have the specified version installed, the build may fail.

## Installation

### Creating a New Project

> **Note:** These are optional if you have already created a project.

1. Create a project directory: `mkdir my-dotnet-app`
2. Create the project: `dotnet create console`


### Installing a TDK client or packages with .NET

> **Note:** The Affinidi TDK clients use authorisation token to authenticate client requests. You can generate a token with the use of the **AuthProvider** package.

To install TDK client or package in dotnet, you need to run the command below:

`dotnet add package <Affinidi-Package-Name>`

Example (installing the AffinidiTdk.AuthProvider Package):

`dotnet add package AffinidiTdk.AuthProvider`

All Affinidi TDK Clients and Packages are available in [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/affinidi).

## Quickstart

> **Note:** When working with tokens, itâ€™s crucial to manage your project access token properly to avoid failures caused by expiration. To help with this, weâ€™ve provided [example code](https://github.com/affinidi/affinidi-tdk-dotnet/tree/main/examples/HookAuthExample/HookAuthExample.cs) that automatically refreshes tokens, ensuring that the client APIs always use a valid, up-to-date token.


Here's a basic example of using the .NET TDK to create a wallet for signing verifiable credentials using the **WalletApi** from **[AffinidiTdk.WalletsClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AffinidiTdk.WalletsClient)**:

```csharp

using AffinidiTdk.AuthProvider;
using AffinidiTdk.WalletsClient.Client;
using AffinidiTdk.WalletsClient.Api;
using AffinidiTdk.WalletsClient.Model;

public class CreateWalletExample
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Instantiate AuthProviderConfig object to load the AuthProvider.
        // Ensure that these sensitive information are kept safe. 
        // You may use `DotNetEnv` to load this info from your .env
        var authProviderParams = new AuthProviderParams
        {
            // Please generate your own Personal Access Tokens (PAT). 
            // Refer to https://docs.affinidi.com/dev-tools/affinidi-tdk/get-access-token/#create-a-personal-access-token-pat for the guide on creating your own PAT.
            ProjectId = "<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>",
            TokenId = "<YOUR-TOKEN-ID>",
            PrivateKey = "<YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY>"
        };

        // create an AuthProvider instance
        AuthProvider authProvider = new AuthProvider(authProviderParams);

        // fetch the projectScopedToken from the authProviderConfig
        string projecScopedToken = await authProvider.FetchProjectScopedTokenAsync();
        
        // create an instance of Configuration from AffinidiTdk.CredentialIssuanceClient
        Configuration config = new Configuration();

        // set the projectScopedToken as apiKey. Note that its using a Map/Dictionary. Key here is "authorization"
        config.AddApiKey("authorization", projectScopedToken);

        // create an instance of WalletApi (from using AffinidiTdk.WalletsClient.Api) and pass the config in the constructor argument.
        WalletApi api = new WalletApi(config);

        // create a CreateWalletInput object with the name and did method
        CreateWalletInput input = new CreateWalletInput(name: "DotNet Wallet", didMethod: CreateWalletInput.DidMethodEnum.Key); 

        // call the CreateWallet api and pass the CreateWalletInput as argument
        CreateWalletResponse result  = api.CreateWallet(input);
        
        Console.WriteLine("CreateWallet Result: " + result.ToJson());
    }
}
```

Running the code will display the result similar to below:

```bash

CreateWallet Result: {
  "wallet": {
    "id": "<WALLET-ID>",
    "did": "<WALLET-DID>",
    "name": "DotNet Wallet",
    ...
  }
}

```
