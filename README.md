# Affinidi Trust Development Kit (Affinidi TDK)

The Affinidi Trust Development Kit (Affinidi TDK) is a modern interface that allows you to easily manage and integrate [Affinidi Elements](https://docs.affinidi.com/docs/affinidi-elements/) and [Frameworks](https://docs.affinidi.com/frameworks/iota-framework/) into your application. It minimises dependencies and enables developers to integrate seamlessly into the [Affinidi Trust Network (ATN)](https://docs.affinidi.com/docs/).

## How do I use Affinidi TDK?

The Affinidi TDK provides three types of modules:

- [Clients](clients), which offer methods to access Affinidi Elements services like Credential Issuance, Credential Verification, and Login Configurations, among others.
- [Packages](packages), which are commonly used utilities/helpers that are self-contained and composable.

## Requirements
