# AffinidiTdk.Common

This package provides common utilities for Affinidi TDK for .NET, such as Vault utility functions to resolve Affinidi Vault links to issue or request credentials.

Other than that it is usually only used internally by Affinidi as a dependency for other packages. It provides URL resolution basend on the environment, but users should not concern with this and use the default production environment.
