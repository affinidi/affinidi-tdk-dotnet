## Example

An example how you can interact with AffinidiTdk.WalletsClient.

Update `example.cs` with your Affinidi ProjectId and PAT secrets (check [getting started with Affinidi](https://docs.affinidi.com/docs/get-started/create-project/) for the details).

Run example with:

```bash
dotnet run
```

ðŸ‘€ Explore /src/Clients/SomeClient/docs for all available methods.

ðŸ‘€ Also check out /tests to see how you can initialize clients with DelegatingHandler in a robust way so token can be auto refreshed once expired.
