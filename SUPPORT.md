## Reporting technical issues

If you have a technical issue with the Affinidi TDK's codebase, you can also create an issue directly in GitHub.

1. Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under
   [Issues](https://github.com/affinidi/affinidi-tdk-dotnet/issues).

2. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem,
   [open a new one](https://github.com/affinidi/affinidi-tdk-dotnet/issues/new).
   Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible,
   and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
