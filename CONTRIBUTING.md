### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and

include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Avoiding obvious comments about things like code styling and indentation.
  - If you see yourself wanting to do that more than once - open an issue with a repo to update the Linter/Prettier rules to address this concern once and for all. **Code reviews should be about logic, not indenting or adding more newlines**
